<h2>Demonstration: VR-HYPERSPACE, The Innovative Use of Virtual Reality to Increase Comfort by Changing the Perception of Self and Space</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Mirabelle D'Cruz, Harshada Patel, Laura Lewis, Sue Cobb, Matthias Bues, Oliver Stefani, Tredeaux Grobler, Kaj Helin, Juhani Viitaniemi, Susanna Aromaa, Bernd Froelich, Stephan Beck, André Kunert, Alexander Kulik, Ioannis Karaseitanidis Panagiotis Psonis, Nikos Frangakis, Mel Slater, Ilias Bergstrom, Elena Kokkinara, Betty Mohler, Markus Leyrer, Florian Soyka, Enrico Gaia, Domenico Tedone, Michael Olbert, Mario Cappitelli</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Our vision is that regardless of future variations in the interior of airplane cabins, we can utilize ever-advancing state-of-the-art virtual and mixed reality technologies with the latest research in neuroscience and psychology to achieve high levels of comfort for passengers. Current surveys on passenger’s experience during air travel reveal that they are least satisfied with the amount and effectiveness of their personal space, and their ability to work, sleep or rest. Moreover, considering current trends it is likely that the amount of available space is likely to decrease and therefore the passenger’s physical comfort during a flight is likely to worsen significantly. Therefore, the main challenge is to enable the passengers to maintain a high level of comfort and satisfaction while being placed in a restricted physical space.</p>



<h2>Product Accessibility Evaluation using Virtual User Models</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Panagiotis Moschonas, Athanasios Tsakiris, Dimitrios Tzovaras</p>
<p><i>Information Technologies Institute (Greece)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
We introduce an open framework for built-in accessibility support
at all stages of product development based on the Virtual User
Model concept. The goal is to introduce simulation-based and VR
testing into the automotive, smart living spaces, workplace, infotainment
and personal healthcare applications areas. Our framework
also aims to ensure that future products and services are
being systematically designed for all people including those with
functional limitations. An open simulation platform parted of several
tools provides automatic simulation feedback and reporting
for guideline/methodologies compliance and quality of service. To
achieve this objective, detailed virtual user physical, cognitive, behavioral
and psychological models as well as the corresponding
simulation models have been integrated to support simulation and
testing at all stages of product planning and development.</p>



<h2>Geometrically-correct projection-based texture mapping onto a cloth</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Yuichiro Fujimoto, Takafumi Taketomi, Goshiro Yamamoto, Jun Miyazaki, Hirokazu Kato, Ross T. Smith, Bruce H. Thomas</p>
<p><i>Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Japan), Tokyo Institue of Technology (Japan), University of South Australia (Australia)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
We demonstrate the geometrically-correct projection-based texture
mapping onto a deformable object like a cloth. This system can
be used to simulate design that involves change in shape, such as
sheets of malleable material. The geometrically-correct projectionbased
texture mapping onto a cloth is conducted using the measurement
of object’s 3D shape and the detection of the retro-reflective
marker on the object’s surface. Rapid prototyping is used as an
example application of this projection technique.</p>


<h2>Application of Hanger Reflex to wrist and waist</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Takuto Nakamura, Narihiro Nishimura, Michi Sato, Hiroyuki Kajimoto</p>
<p><i>The University of Electro (Japan), Japan Science and Technology Agency (Japan)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
When a wire hanger is placed sideways on the head, and the
temporal region is sandwiched by the hanger, the head rotates
unexpectedly. This phenomenon has been named the “Hanger
Reflex”. Although it is a simple method for producing pseudo-
force sensation, the use of the wire hanger in this way has up until
now been limited in posistion to the head. Here we report a new
finding that when a wrist or waist is equipped with a device of a
larger circumferance the arm or the body rotates involuntarily.
This fact suggests that the Hanger Reflex principle might be
applicable to parts of the body other than the head, leading to the
possible compact whole-body force display. This paper
documents the development and testing of the devices and,
suggesting stable presentation of the rotational force</p>



<h2>An Ungrounded Tactile Feedback Device to Portray Force and Torque-
Like Interactions in Virtual Environments</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Ashley L. Guinan, Markus N. Montandon, Andrew J. Doxon, and William R. Provancher</p>
<p><i>University of Utah (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Our lab has developed a haptic feedback device to provide
ungrounded tactile feedback through the motion of actuated
sliding plate contactors. Interaction with a virtual environment is
provided to a user through a device equipped with tactile feedback
and six degree-of-freedom spatial position sensing. Our tactile
feedback device is composed of three sliding plate skin stretch
displays positioned around the handle, providing feedback to a
user’s palm. Our dual-handed tactile feedback system allows
independent motion of hands, while providing feedback that
creates a kinesthetic experience. We demonstrate fundamental
physical interactions such as mass, spring, and damper
interactions, which are the building blocks used in every virtual
model. Various virtual environments are used to demonstrate
physical interactions with objects.</p>



<h2>MUSE: Understanding Traditional Dances</h2>

<p><b>Author:</b>
Muqeem Khan
<i>(Northwestern University in Qatar (Qatar))</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
This demo encapsulates the possible manifestation of Middle
Eastern indigenous dance, Al Ardha, in the form of a serious
gaming environment. The presentation also illustrates the
interconnection and possible transformation of Intangible Cultural
Heritage (ICH) content, such as traditional dances, into a digital
kinesthetic learning system. The system is called Mimicry
Understanding and Safeguarding Environment (MUSE). It is
designed to help museum visitors learn traditional or indigenous
dances with the help of motion-sensing technologies. MUSE is a
multidisciplinary research project and is expected to analyze the
intricacies of various indigenous dances, particularly the Arabic
sword dance. MUSE interface is expected to facilitate museum
visitors’ awareness, learning, and practice of the Al Ardha dance
of the Middle Eastern region. Through its easy-to-learn and userfriendly
interface, MUSE can facilitate and foster playfulness and
user engagement to enhance the experience of museum visitors.</p>



<h2>Tablet-Based Interaction Panels for Immersive Environments</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
David M. Krum, Thai Phan, Lauren Cairco Dukes, Peter Wang, Mark Bolas</p>
<p><i>USC Institute for Creative Technologies (USA), Clemson University (USA), Continuum Analytics (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
With the current widespread interest in head mounted displays, we
perceived a need for devices that support expressive and adaptive
interaction in a low-cost, eyes-free manner. Leveraging rapid prototyping
techniques for fabrication, we have designed and manufactured
a variety of panels that can be overlaid on multi-touch tablets
and smartphones. The panels are coupled with an app running on
the multi-touch device that exchanges commands and state information
over a wireless network with the virtual reality application.
Sculpted features of the panels provide tactile disambiguation of
control widgets and an onscreen heads-up display provides interaction
state information. A variety of interaction mappings can
be provided through software to support several classes of interaction
techniques in virtual environments. We foresee additional
uses for applications where eyes-free use and adaptable interaction
interfaces can be beneficial.</p>


<h2>The Virtual World Framework: Collaborative Virtual Environments on the Web</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Eric Burns, David Easter, Rob Chadwick, David A. Smith, Carl Rosengrant</p>
<p><i>Lockheed Martin (USA), ADL Colab (USA), OSD (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Software distribution and installation is a logistical issue for large
enterprises. Web applications are often a good solution because
users can instantly receive application updates on any device
without needing special permissions to install them on their
hardware. Until recently, it was not possible to create 3D multiuser
virtual environment-based web applications that didn’t
require installing a browser plugin. However, recent web
standards have made it possible. We present the Virtual World
Framework (VWF), a software framework for creating 3D
multiuser web applications. We are using VWF to create
applications for team training and collaboration. VWF can be
downloaded at <a href="http://virtual.wf">http://virtual.wf</a>.</p>


<h2>Diplopia: A Virtual Reality Game Designed To Help Amblyopics</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
James Blaha, Manish Gupta</p>
<p><i>Apollo VR (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Virtual reality has the potential to measure and help many vision
problems. More than 3% of the population have amblyopia,
commonly known as lazy eye, a weakness and impairment of
vision in one or both of the eyes [1]. Amblyopia often results in a
suppression of the information coming from the bad eye, and a
loss of stereoscopic vision as a result. It was long thought that
people with amblyopia could not improve the vision in their bad
eye or gain stereoscopic vision after a critical age of 10-12 years
old. Recent research indicates the adult brain is more plastic with
regards to suppressiion than previously thought. [2]. Inspired by
this, we have built a virtual reality game, called Diplopia, using
Unity3D which utilizes the Oculus Rift head-mounted display
(HMD) and the Leap Motion controller to help people with
amblyopia restore vision in their amblyopic eye.</p>


<h2>AR Jigsaw Puzzle with RGB-D Based Detection of Texture-Less Pieces</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
João Paulo Lima, João Marcelo Teixeira, Veronica Teichrieb</p>
<p><i>DEINFO-UFRPE (Brazil), Voxar Labs, CIn-UFPE (Brazil)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
This demo presents an AR application that helps the user to solve a jigsaw puzzle that consists of non-textured pieces with a discriminative shape. The pieces are detected, their poses are estimated and the ones that are correctly assembled are highlighted. In order to detect the pieces, the Depth-Assisted Rectification of Contours (DARC) method is used, which performs detection and pose estimation of texture-less planar objects using an RGB-D camera.</p>


<h2>Ubiquitous Virtual Reality ‘To-Go’</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Aryabrata Basu, Kyle Johnsen</p>
<p><i>University of Georgia (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
We propose to demonstrate a ubiquitous immersive virtual
reality system that is highly scalable and accessible to a larger
audience. With the advent of handheld and wearable devices, we
have seen it gain considerable popularity among the common
masses.</p>
<p>We present a practical design of such a system that offers the
core affordances of immersive virtual reality in a portable and
untethered configuration. In addition, we have developed an
extensive immersive virtual experience that involves engaging
users visually and aurally. This is an effort towards integrating
VR into the space and time of user workflows.</p>


<h2>Automatic Acquisition and Animation of Virtual Avatars</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Ari Shapiro, Andrew Feng, Ruizhe Wang, Gerard Medioni, Mark Bolas, Evan A. Suma</p>
<p><i>USC Institute for Creative Technologies (USA), University of Southern California (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
The USC Institute for Creative Technologies will demonstrate a
pipline for automatic reconstruction and animation of lifelike 3D
avatars acquired by rotating the user’s body in front of a single
Microsoft Kinect sensor. Based on a fusion of state-of-the-art
techniques in computer vision, graphics, and animation, this
approach can produce a fully rigged character model suitable for
real-time virtual environments in less than four minutes.</p>


<h2>NASA Telexploration Project Demo</h2>

<p><b>Authors:</b>
Jeff Norris, Scott Davidoff</p>
<p><i>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (USA)</i></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
NASA’s Telexploration Project seeks to make us better explorers by building immersive environments that feel like we are really there.  The Mission Operations Innovation Office and its Operations Laboratory at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory founded the Telexploration Project, and is researching how immersive visualization and natural human-robot interaction can enable mission scientists, engineers, and the general public to interact with NASA spacecraft and alien environments in a more effective way.  These efforts have been accelerated through partnerships with many different companies, especially in the video game industry.  These demos will exhibit some of the progress made at NASA and its commercial partnerships by allowing attendees to experience Mars data acquired from NASA spacecraft in a head mounted display using several rendering and interaction techniques.</p>
